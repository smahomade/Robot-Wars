## About
Project was made in my 2nd year in City University using C++ Object Oriented Language, the game simulates robots moving on a grid based command list from an input file (commands.txt). Each robot has properties like a model number, team number (1,2,3...n), position (X and Y coordinates), and the direction it is facing (North, South, East or West).

## Instruction
1. Download all the files in one folder
2. If you're using VS Code, make sure you compiled it by installing MSYS2 or MinGW and getting the extension C++/C
3. adjust the text files to your needs
4. make sure to run both files as one for example <br>
/* cd "c:\Users\[Name]\Desktop\[Folder]\" ; if ($?) { g++ main.cpp robot.cpp -o main } ; if ($?) { .\main } */


<b>UNDERGOING: Due to some bugs, this project will be reworked and will be developed in a new folder in the future<b>
