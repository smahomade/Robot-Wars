1. Download all the files in one folder
2. If you're using VS Code, make sure you compiled it by installing MSYS2 or MinGW
3. adjust the text files to your needs
4. make sure to run both files as one for example
/* cd "c:\Users\[Name]\Desktop\[Folder]\" ; if ($?) { g++ main.cpp robot.cpp -o main } ; if ($?) { .\main } */


PLEASE NOTE: This project was done in my 2nd year at City University, some bugs may still consist in the program but for expereince purposes i will be leaving this code as it is, since it was submited like this.

UNDERGOING: Due to some bugs, this project will be reworked and will be developed in a new folder in the future
